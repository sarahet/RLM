include (ExternalProject)

# Example call:
#
# ```cmake
# declare_datasource(
#   FILE pdb100d.ent.gz # build/data/pdb100d.ent.gz
#   URL ftp://ftp.wwpdb.org/pub/pdb/data/structures/divided/pdb/00/pdb100d.ent.gz # 16KiloByte
#   URL_HASH SHA256=c2b8f884568b07f58519966e256e2f3aa440508e8013bd10e0ee338e138e62a0)
# ```
#
# Options:
#
# declare_datasource(FILE <datasource name> URL <url1> [<url2>...] [URL_HASH <algo>=<hashValue>] [<option>...])
#
# FILE <datasource name> (required):
#    The name of the downloaded file (must be unique across all declared datasources).
#    This will put the file into the ``<build>/data/<datasource name>`` folder.
#
# URL <url1> [<url2>...] (required):
#    List of paths and/or URL(s) of the external datasource. When more than one URL is given, they are tried in
#    turn until one succeeds. A URL may be an ordinary path in the local file system (in which case it must be the only
#    URL provided) or any downloadable URL supported by the file(DOWNLOAD) command. A local filesystem path may refer to
#    either an existing directory or to an archive file, whereas a URL is expected to point to a file which can be
#    treated as an archive.
#
# URL_HASH <algo>=<hashValue> (optional):
#    Hash of the archive file to be downloaded. The argument should be of the form <algo>=<hashValue> where algo can be
#    any of the hashing algorithms supported by the file() command. Specifying this option is strongly recommended for
#    URL downloads, as it ensures the integrity of the downloaded content. It is also used as a check for a previously
#    downloaded file, allowing connection to the remote location to be avoided altogether if the local directory already
#    has a file from an earlier download that matches the specified hash.
#
# This uses under the hood ExternalProject's and you can pass any viable option of ExternalProject to this function and
# overwrite the default behaviour. See https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/ExternalProject.html for more
# information.
